        <h2>Jamaica Style Curry Chicken</h2>
            <p>Wondering how to make curry 
                chicken? This is the recipe that
                 I put together from visiting 
                 various websites, verbal 
                 consultations, and just 
                 experimenting on my own and 
                 with my family. It's rich and 
                 hearty, with flavor that's 
                 great when you can't get the 
                 real thing in the islands. 
                 Try a variety of hot peppers to 
                 change the flavor â€” even sweet 
                 bell peppers give it a different 
                 taste. Use fresh thyme to really 
                 bring out the fresh taste.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 vegetabl oil</li>
            <li>1 oion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
            <li>2 slices habanero pepper (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Jamaican-style curry powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoons ground thyme</li>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves,
                 cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>half teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, tomato, habanero pepper, garlic, curry powder, and thyme and cook, stirring, until onion is golden, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken and cook until chicken is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour water into the skillet. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 30 minutes. Season with salt.</li>
